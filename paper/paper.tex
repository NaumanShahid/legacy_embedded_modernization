	\begin{abstract}
		Legacy embedded C codebases are widely used in critical systems, yet maintaining and modernizing them poses significant safety and reliability challenges. This paper presents an approach for the safe modernization of legacy embedded C software combined with a virtualized testing framework that enables efficient validation without the need for hardware-in-the-loop setups. The proposed methodology aims to improve code safety, maintainability, and test coverage, contributing to more reliable embedded system development and maintenance.

	\section{Introduction}
	\label{sec:intro}
	Embedded software forms the backbone of many critical systems such as automotive controllers, industrial automation, and aerospace applications. Much of this software has been developed in C over decades, often without adherence to modern software engineering practices. Legacy embedded C codebases tend to be monolithic, poorly documented, and tightly coupled with hardware, making maintenance and modernization both difficult and risky \cite{lewis2019modernizing}.
	
	As safety standards and complexity requirements evolve, organizations face the challenge of modernizing this codebase to improve safety, maintainability, and testability. However, direct modifications can introduce regressions or obscure defects, potentially compromising system reliability. 
	
	To address these issues, this paper explores a dual approach: (1) \textit{Safe Modernization} leveraging static analysis and incremental refactoring to clean legacy code without behavioral changes, and (2) \textit{Virtualized Testing} which decouples software verification from physical hardware, enabling comprehensive testing in a simulated environment.
	
	This study is performed as an independent research effort, highlighting accessible methods for researchers and engineers without extensive institutional support or hardware access.
	
	\subsection*{Inspiration}
	The motivation for this work arose from ongoing discussions and shared experiences in active embedded systems communities and open source projects. Influential platforms include \texttt{EmbeddedRelated.com} \cite{embeddedrelated}, Stack Overflow's embedded systems tag \cite{stackoverflow}, and Reddit's r/embedded community \cite{redditembedded}. These communities provide practical insights and collective knowledge on challenges and techniques for modernizing legacy embedded C code, which helped shape the approach presented in this paper.
	
	\section{Related Work}
	\label{sec:related}
	Legacy embedded software modernization has attracted research attention due to the critical nature of the systems involved. Wang et al. \cite{wang2021safe} presented techniques for refactoring embedded C code with safety constraints, focusing on memory safety and concurrency issues. Lewis and Martinez \cite{lewis2019modernizing} analyzed common modernization challenges including deprecated APIs, global state management, and magic numbers.
	
	In parallel, virtualized testing frameworks have been proposed to reduce reliance on expensive hardware-in-the-loop setups. Smith and Kumar \cite{smith2020virtualized} demonstrated the use of software simulators combined with unit testing frameworks to increase test coverage and accelerate development cycles.
	
	While prior works have often assumed organizational infrastructure and resources, this paper targets a minimal setup that independent researchers can replicate.
	
	\section{Methodology}
	\label{sec:methodology}
	
	\subsection{Codebase and Language Considerations}
	While the core modernization effort targets legacy embedded C codebases, our implementation adopts a hybrid C and C++ approach. The legacy modules are written in C to reflect real-world embedded system constraints and legacy styles. To facilitate unit testing and leverage modern testing frameworks such as Google Test, auxiliary test harnesses and interfaces are implemented in C++. This approach aligns with common industry practices where embedded C codebases are incrementally modernized while integrating contemporary C++ testing and tooling environments.
	
	\subsection{Safe Modernization of Legacy C Code}
	Our approach to modernization starts with static code analysis using tools such as \texttt{clang-tidy} and \texttt{cppcheck}. These tools identify common code smells including:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Unsafe global variables and hidden state
		\item Magic numbers and hard-coded constants
		\item Deprecated APIs and unsafe function usage (e.g., \texttt{printf})
		\item Code style inconsistencies affecting readability and maintainability
	\end{itemize}
	
	Incremental refactoring is then performed to replace these with safer, more maintainable constructs such as `const` declarations, named constants/enums, and encapsulated data structures. Refactoring is done carefully to preserve original behavior, with every change followed by running regression tests.
	
	\subsection{Virtualized Testing Framework}
	Testing embedded software traditionally requires hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) setups, which are costly and time-consuming. To circumvent this, we build a virtualized testing environment using:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Google Test} for unit and integration tests \cite{googletest}
		\item \textbf{Software simulation} of sensor inputs and hardware peripherals
		\item \textbf{Code coverage} measurement with \texttt{lcov}
		\item \textbf{Memory error detection} via \texttt{valgrind}
	\end{itemize}
	
	The test framework allows repeated execution of embedded code modules in a controlled environment. Sensor values are simulated with boundary and stress inputs to verify correct system behavior.
	
	\subsection{Development Setup}
	The project is developed and tested on a Windows 11 PC running WSL2 Ubuntu 24.04 LTS. Key tools installed include:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \texttt{gcc/g++}, \texttt{make}, \texttt{cmake} for building
		\item \texttt{clang-tidy}, \texttt{clang-format} for static analysis and style
		\item \texttt{google-test} as a git submodule for testing
		\item \texttt{valgrind} and \texttt{lcov} for runtime verification
	\end{itemize}
	
	Detailed build instructions and environment setup are provided in the repository's README.
	
	\section{Results and Discussion}
	\label{sec.results_and_discussions}
	
	\subsection{Performance Metrics}
	
	We evaluated the modernized embedded codebase on three different hardware setups to demonstrate portability and performance consistency:

		\item \textbf{Setup 1}: AMD Ryzen 7 5800X3D, 32GB DDR4-3000, RTX 2080Ti GPU
		\item \textbf{Setup 2}: HP Omen-17 Laptop, Intel i7 8750H, 16GB DDR4-2667, GTX 1060 GPU
		\item \textbf{Setup 3}: AMD Ryzen 5 2600, 16GB DDR4-3200, RTX 2060 Super GPU
	\end{itemize}

	\section{Experiments and Results}
	\label{sec:results}
	
	\subsection{Case Study: Legacy Embedded Project}
	We applied our methodology to a sample legacy embedded C project consisting of:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Sensor reading modules with global variables representing hardware state
		\item Control algorithms implementing feedback loops
		\item System initialization and utility modules
	\end{itemize}
	
	\subsection{Static Analysis and Refactoring Outcomes}
	Initial static analysis identified over 200 warnings, including unsafe globals and magic numbers. After refactoring:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Over 80\% of warnings were resolved
		\item Global state was encapsulated into structures with restricted access
		\item Magic numbers replaced with meaningful named constants
		\item Code formatting improved for readability and maintainability
	\end{itemize}
	
	These changes were verified by passing all regression tests to ensure behavior preservation.
	
	\subsection{Virtualized Test Coverage and Validation}
	The virtualized testing framework achieved:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 87.5\% line coverage across core modules, measured with \texttt{lcov}
		\item Successful detection of injected faults in sensor data handling
		\item Zero memory leaks or invalid accesses confirmed by \texttt{valgrind}
	\end{itemize}
	
	Tests ran efficiently on a Ryzen 7 5800X3D desktop with typical execution times under seconds per test run.
	
	\section{Discussion}
	The combined modernization and virtualized testing approach significantly improved code safety and testability while avoiding hardware dependency. This enables faster development iterations and reduces risk of regression bugs.
	
	Limitations include the lack of real-time hardware interaction testing and potential differences in timing behavior, which future work will address.
	
	\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
	This paper demonstrated a practical methodology for safe modernization and virtualized testing of legacy embedded C codebases. The approach is accessible to independent researchers and small teams, providing improved software reliability with minimal infrastructure.
	
	Future directions include extending the framework to support timing and real-time constraints, integrating hardware abstraction layers, and automating refactoring with machine learning techniques.
